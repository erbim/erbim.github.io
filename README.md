 **Jude the Apostle** *(Saint)*

*Jude was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament. He is generally identified as Thaddeus and is also variously called Judas and is considered as the founding father and the first Catholicos-Patriarch of the Armenian Apostolic Church. He is sometimes identified with Jude, the brother of Jesus, but is clearly distinguished from Judas Iscariot, the disciple who betrayed Jesus prior to his crucifixion. Catholic writer Michal Hunt suggests that Judas Thaddaeus became known as Jude after early translators of the New Testament from Greek into English sought to distinguish him from Judas Iscariot and subsequently abbreviated his forename. Most versions of the New Testament in languages other than English and French refer to Judas and Jude by the same name.*

   > *He was rather the Patron Saint of Hope, or the "Impossible"*

*I still remember the first day of our parish service.. Right after our hardwork of cleaning, We went ahead and reflect about the experience we had.. And on top of that, a sister discussed who St. Jude was, and I remember her saying that people come here to the parish so that they can overcome the `challenges` that they are currently facing..*

*It is him, St. Jude of Thaddeus who helps us overcome our hardships in life.. It is he who we come to when we need help. So that in the end, it is he who helps us get back up..*
